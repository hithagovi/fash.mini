 Mini Web Project 🚀

This is an unfinished mini project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java**, and a bit of **PHP**.
It's part of my learning journey in web development and backend integration.While building this fashion blog website, I learnt how to design and structure responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a **modern and visually appealing layout** that suits the fashion industry’s aesthetics.
I understood the importance of selecting the right **color palettes, fonts, and layouts** to create an engaging user experience, while keeping the design **mobile-friendly.**
I also gained experience in writing **SEO-friendly and visually appealing blog content**, organizing it into categories and tags for better navigation, and using high-quality images to enhance storytelling. 
Through this project, I improved my skills in **Git/GitHub for version control**, optimized assets for faster loading, and used browser developer tools for **debugging and adjustments**. Beyond the technical aspects, I learnt time management between design, development, and content writing, developed a better understanding of brand identity in web design, and enhanced my **attention to detail in both visuals and code.**
