 Mini Web Project 🚀

This is an unfinished mini project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java**, and a bit of **PHP**.
It's part of my learning journey in web development and backend integration.While building this fashion blog website, I learnt how to design and structure responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a modern and visually appealing layout that suits the fashion industry’s aesthetics.
I understood the importance of selecting the right color palettes, fonts, and layouts to create an engaging user experience, while keeping the design mobile-friendly.
I also gained experience in writing SEO-friendly and visually appealing blog content, organizing it into categories and tags for better navigation, and using high-quality images to enhance storytelling. 
Through this project, I improved my skills in Git/GitHub for version control, optimized assets for faster loading, and used browser developer tools for debugging and adjustments. Beyond the technical aspects, I learnt time management between design, development, and content writing, developed a better understanding of brand identity in web design, and enhanced my attention to detail in both visuals and code.
